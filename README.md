# MapExplorations

Exploring the effects of modifying spatial aggregation levels on the visual spatial distribution. Moving from Census tracks to neighborhoods to zipcodes, all within the Los Angeles area. Data used include Korean restaurants in LA (from the yelp API, cleaned up in Google Refine) and streetlights in LA (obtained from the city of LA). 

This problem is sometimes called the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and apparently also comes up when trying to do predictions of point process data like earthquakes. It's not clear that there's a good solution to it.
